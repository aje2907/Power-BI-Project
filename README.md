Hi Guys!

In this project, I have analysed the sales data of an online retail store, that is operating in 7 different countries, selling over 600 products, and over $16 Million sales in the year 2013.

Some of the interesting observations made from the data is that the storeâ€™s predominant sales is from North America, with customers older than 40 years of age contributing to more than 65% of total sales. Though their sales have dropped in 2012 compared to 2011, it has increased significantly in 2013.

Please feel free to have a look at my dashboard by downloading the pbix file. I have also attached some screenshots below.
